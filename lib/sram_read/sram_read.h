/**
 * @brief Reads a byte from the external SRAM.
 *
 * Operation sequence:
 * 1. Sets the eight data lines as input.  
 * 2. Puts the 15-bit address on the address bus.  
 * 3. Sets CS\_ (Chip Select) to low level.  
 * 4. Sets OE\_ (Output Enable) to low level.  
 * 5. Sample the data lines.  
 * 6. Release the control lines.
 *
 * @param address 15-bit address (0 â€“ 0x7FFF) to read from.
 * @return Byte present at the specified @p address.
 *
 * @warning This function assumes that the 6502 is currently in
 *          high z trough `6502_deactivate()` and that `_delay_us()`
 *          is accurate for the current clock frequency.
 *
 * @note    For UART debugging, define `DEBUG_READ` or `DEBUG_READ_PRINT`
 *          and uncomment the block at the end of the function.
